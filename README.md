# PacManGame
In this project, I emulated Pacman software from a sole backend perspective using an object-oriented implementation in Java. I allow multiple coin rooms along with a start and end room with a ghost tracking the Pacman which the user is moving by random movement set by a random generator. The goal is to collect all the coins and get to the finished room before the ghost in this case reaches you.
